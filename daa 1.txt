Bivariate Analysis->is one of the statistiscal analysis where two variables 

are observed. The goals is to understand wheaher and how two variable
are related
if it is a quantative analysis that examines two denoted x and y . bivariate
analysis aims to understand to what extenent one variable predict the value of another variable

total hours in week  marks

Bivariate analysis is the study of relationship between two variable whether
numerical,categorical , or one of each to understand how they are associated with
each other.

A scatter plot is a graph that shows the relationship between 
two numerical variable using plotted point

covariance is a measure that indicates how two numerical
 variable change together

corelation coefficient :



calculation of values for correlation coefficient are performed


using  a computer , although here , you can find the step
to find the correlation coefficient by hand.
this coefficient acknowledges you if the variable are related

-1---> strong negative correlation
-0.5->stronger
0---> no correlation
+0.5--> stronger
+1---> strong positive corelation

this indicates quite strong , positive correlation. data that looks like
this would have very high , positive product moment coefficient

Anova test -> Determines the impact of continious variable on 
a categorical
variable . 
it is basically used to compare more than two groups

T test-> Determine the impact of continious variable on the categorical
variable . it is basically used to compare two groups , 
if they are significantly

chi square test-> it is used to determine whether 
the association between two categorical variable
is satistically significant or not.
