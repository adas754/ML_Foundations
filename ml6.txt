Hyperplane

Marginal plane 

support vector 

Hard Marginal plane -> There is no any kind of missclassification.

Soft marginal plane -> The missclassifcation will be there.


The distance between two marginal plane should be high

we can classify our data. 


y=mx+c

w1x1+w2x2+b=0


wTx1+b=1

wTx2+b=-1

-  -  +
--------------------------
wT(x1-x2)=2  

we can write in following way
w-> Magnititude

wT(x1-x2)/|w|=2/|w|

max (w,b) 2/|w|  => will calculate distance between marginal plane 

The 2/W basically represent separation between two class 

it will help to->

1. Increase Robustness -> A largar margin makes the model less sensetive to noise and outlier

2. Improve generalization-> A larger marginal plane reduces overfiting and improves model  ability to generallize the data

3. Enhance classification->  by maximizing  margin svm aims to find the optimal decision boundary that accurately separate classes.

for all accurate data point yi*(WTxi+b)>=1

constraint
yi ​ is the class label (+1 or -1) for each training instance.
xi is the feature vector for the i-th training instance.


cost function
-
minimize (w,b) W/2+ci summation of i=1 to w ζi

ci=>How many point we want to avoid misclassification.

ζ -> Summation of the distance of the incorrect data point from the marginal plane
i

 SVM kernal -> SVM kernal are function that tranform the original data into a higher dimentional space , allowing svm to leran non linear decision 

boundary


1, linear kernal- suitable for linearly separable data

2. polynomial kernal-> non linear with polynomial relationship

3. RBF-> Suitable for non linear dta with gaussian distribution

4.Sigmoid-> similar to logistic Regression




KMeans Algoritm -> 

1. We have to decide k cluster

if k=3 that means you have created three groups

2. Intialze centrioid

3. Assign cluster

4. Move centriod

5. Finish
