k=7

1. Define k value it should be odd number
2. we have to calculate distance with each and every point in 0's and 1's class
3. euclidean / manhaton

4. check nearest point . 


5 points are nearest point from k and 5 points are situated in 0's class

2 point are nearest from k and it is situated in 1's class


5. k will go in 0's class.


k=7


5 point are nearest point from k and situated in o's class . 0's

k will move into 0's class.
