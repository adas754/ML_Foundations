Machine learning-> Ml is a subset of ai that allows 
computer to
learn from and make decision based on data.



iq cgpa placement-> dependent column / output column
8  8.5  yes
4  8    yes
7 4.4   no
if our dependent column/ output column data is categorial
then we will call classification.

 6 8.9 

The email is spam or not 

if text=='super':
   print('spam')
elif text=='exclusive':
   print('spam')
elif text=='super excellent offer':
    print('spam')

text spam or not
 1000 data



Ml -> supervised ml and unsupervised ml

iq cgpa placement-> dependent column / output column
8  8.5  yes
4  8    yes
7 4.4   no

in supervised ml algo there must be a output column

House price prediction

Location Size Price 
hyd       3bhk  80000 Regression problem

when we have numerical data in our output column that time 
we will call that is part of regression.

when we have a output column that time we will tell that it is a 

supervised ml 

Text             review
the class is good  positive
worst              negative

unsupervised ml -> in that unsupervised there is no output column. 

based on that input data it will create a group

classification and Regression


Text             review
the class is good  positive 1
worst              negative 0
if in your output coulumn categorical data/ text data/ discreate 
category is there then it will be a classification



1. Spam email detection -> c
2.Predict a patient diabetic or non diabatic -> c

3.Student performance score -> r

4. Flight price-> r

5.Stock price forecasting -> r 

6. Image Recognition -> cat or dog c

7.Sentiment analysis c

8. Cricket score prediction r

9. The cricket match will happen or not based on weather c

10. Vegitable classification . c


Type of ml
classification and regression
in that classification if two claases is there that means it will be binary classification
if more than two classes are there it will be multiclass classification

Regression -> Linear regression , Lasso , Ridge

Classification -> Logistic Regression , Naive bayes 

we have some algorithm that is for both classification and regressiom
Decision tree
Support vector machine
Random forest
KNN


Linear Regression
