Performance score of Linear Regression

1. R-squared
2.Adjusted R squared

if the score towards means model performance is good
.

i want to predict a house price

size of house no of bedroom location price

if you are using r squared and all are feature is
relavent than there is no problem

Gender age Degree size of house no of bedroom location price

if you want to calculate the model performance using the R squared
it will not give accurate result

r square 76
80%

Adjusted r square it will balance . it will give exact 
model performance.'

Assumtion of logistic Regression
- the target should be binary
- No multicolinearity
- data should be lineary separable
