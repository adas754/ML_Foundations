I want to model performance of classifier

How i will check

Precesion TP/TP+FP

RECALL= TP/TP+FN

ACCURACY=TP+TN/TP+TN+FP+FN

F1SCORE=2*PRE*RECALL/PRE+RECALL


Burnt incident happend in one shoping mall

owner will shell in very less price 

who will be benfited , customer will be benifited.

Tpr=TP/TP+FN

FPR=FP/FP+TN
[0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8]
